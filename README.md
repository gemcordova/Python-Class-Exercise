## 🧠 Problems to Solve  
Challenge yourself by completing the following exercises:

---

### 1️⃣ Exercise 01: Multiplication Table Generator  
✨ **Objective:** Ask the user for a number and print its multiplication table from **1 to 10**.

---

### 2️⃣ Exercise 02: Sum of Even Numbers  
✨ **Objective:** Ask the user for a number (**n**). Use a loop to compute the sum of all even numbers from **1 to n**.

---

### 3️⃣ Exercise 03: Star Pattern Pyramid  
✨ **Objective:** Ask the user for the number of rows and print a **pyramid star pattern**.

---

### 4️⃣ Exercise 04: Number Guessing Game  
✨ **Objective:** The program picks a secret number. The user keeps guessing until correct. Show hints like **“Too high”** or **“Too low.”**

---

### 5️⃣ Exercise 05: Running Total Calculator  
✨ **Objective:** Let the user input numbers one at a time. Keep adding to a running total. Stops when the user enters **0**, then display the final total.

---

### 6️⃣ Exercise 06: Login Attempt Limiter
